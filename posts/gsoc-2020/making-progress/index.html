  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>I started off last week attempting to get the infamous <code>zoomBox</code> working with the
new rendering pipeline I wrote for our Director engine. A zoomBox effect is the
classic window movement animation in classic Mac OS: When you open or close a
window, you see many spectral rectangles in between the window&rsquo;s origin and
destination. Even though I haven&rsquo;t seen any games actually use it, this function
was the first motivation I was given reworking the rendering pipeline. Before,
we could not look ahead into the next frame to get the dimensions of a sprite.</p>
<p>Moreover, before, we had to cache a copy of the screen so it could be restored
after the animation was finished. I used the same trick that it seemed Mac OS
used with many interface elements, though. As the animation was drawn, the
pixels of the rectangle were inverted, and then on a second pass they were
inverted back. Just like matrices, invertible animations are quite nice.</p>
<p>I also modified much of my code from the previous weeks to get a major part of
our benchmark kit, Macromedia&rsquo;s own The Apartment, working properly. Normally,
when a sprite is puppeted, its position is not updated from the score. So
animated puppeted sprites are impossible, which made my job a bit easier. There is
another case, however, that required a major rework of the rendering code I had
already written. I didn&rsquo;t realize that with a sprite simply declared moveable,
rather than a full puppet, it can be animated. Thus, we could no longer store
the current point in each sprite as it flew by over the playback head &ndash; that
would give us very strange jitters. Instead, location information needed to be
consistent across frames. So, another level of abstraction was needed, a
<code>Channel</code> class that would keep track of this intraframe information.</p>
<p>It feels strange to summarize into a single sentence a task that took me several
hours to complete. But, I suppose this is the very nature of software
engineering. Over the past weeks, I have learned very much about being patient
with myself and taking breaks when I need to. I&rsquo;m going to try to be a bit
better about working for a long time on the weekends, even though I find it very
enjoyable.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, I think it was, djsrv fixed a Lingo issue and I fixed several
rendering\widget issues that allowed me to get more than a quarter of the way
into Warlock &ndash; and even then, it was my choice to stop and not a misplaced null
pointer&rsquo;s. :) This is an exciting progress milestone for us. Ah, the beautiful
Belshazzar!</p>
<p><img src="/posts/gsoc-2020/making-progress/making-progress-2.png"></p>
<p>On Friday, I didn&rsquo;t commit much because I got distracted by an engine I had
mentioned briefly before, the Media Station engine. Many of the Disney Animated
Storybook CD-ROMs were developed with this engine, as well as one of the few
Living Books titles that didn&rsquo;t use Mohawk. Strangerke warned me a few weeks ago
that the executable was very complicated, but I found some success using
moralrecordings&rsquo; <a href="https://github.com/moralrecordings/mrcrowbar">Mr. Crowbar</a> to peer inside the assets. They seemed like easy
RIFF, but nearly all the chunks seem to be named some variation of &ldquo;igod&rdquo; and
there&rsquo;s some extra structure hidden inside the chunks. Bitmap and waveform data
is clearly visible, though, so there&rsquo;s probably not far to go to understand the
format. After GSoC is over, I would hope stay on and keep working with this
engine &ndash; plus Director, of course.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;d better get back to Director. I&rsquo;m now working on getting all of the
inks (blitting modes) playing nicely together. Graphics programming has proven
pretty neat, even if it often goes slowly.</p>
