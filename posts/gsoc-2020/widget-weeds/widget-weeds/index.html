  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>Last time, I promised I would give an update on QuickDraw and the Macintosh GUI
emulator. This second major part of reworking the rendering pipeline, which i
thought I could finish in the first week of coding, has taken more time and gone
deeper than I expected. When I am coding I am well aware of wasting time in
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak%5Fshaving">shaving the yak</a>. I mentioned in our Discord the other day that I might have
experienced mission creep. Let me explain.</p>
<p>MY initial goal was to move over Director&rsquo;s text rendering to the <a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/master/graphics/macgui/maceditabletext.cpp">enhanced Mac
text class</a> that sev wrote for us earlier this year. I spent the early part of
that week implementing the different kinds of text properties that Director
permits putting on text &ndash; straightforward effects like shadows, framing, and
proper text alignment. (I now realize what complex work goes into graphics
management for even a simple text editor.) Then, I created a new class (widget)
specifically for buttons and did the similar work for the classic Mac&rsquo;s three
button styles. This took me to about Wednesday last week, and this part of my
work went fairly quickly. I even got several movies mostly working, including
the <code>stageColor</code> movie (a simple one that flashed the emulator background color
very quickly &ndash; I won&rsquo;t show it because I myself am photosensitive). This showed
off saveral pieces of the work I had done: Drawing text with transparency and
extra features, as well as reading button states properly.</p>
<p>I then realized that in order for the window manager to process widget events in
the proper order, it needed to have some concept of priority &ndash; a mirror of
channels in Director. So then, I thought, we have only four major visual cast
types in our Director engine: text, buttons, shapes, and bitmaps. Why not have
all those be known to the window manager as widgets? This would accomplish
another of the refactoring tasks I had been given, reducing the bloat of the
Stage class by moving drawing methods away from there.</p>
<p>Then, I got rather bogged down later in the week in understanding the minutiae
of the window manager, and I realized that much of the outward-facing code
in our Director events manager could be handled better in the MacGUI manager
instead; this was added to my list of items to finish. (You see what I mean
about shaving yaks.) There were a few other version-specific irritations that I
also tried to figure out; this took me into the weekend.</p>
<p>I soon had a lot of deeply connected tasks that seemed rather overwhelming as
the first week ended; I realized that I had expanded the range of my next PR far
beyond where I initially started. Until the weekend, I thought I was making good
time. After I did not do much over the weekend to catch up with mechatronics
research lab at where I work at university, I realized that trying to change
everything at once is an excellent way to get behind. I do not want this to
happen, so I talked to sev yesterday to help get me back on track.</p>
<p>I will post some screenshots later this week, once my improvements are complete
enough to merge at least some of them. I believe our prime test move, The
Apartment, will soon yield some good results in previously broken movies. I have
known for a while my tendency toward over-engineering and trying to &ldquo;go solo,&rdquo;
so confronting such mission creep in the very first week of coding was quite
helpful for me.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll hear from me again soon!</p>
