  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>I recently had the interesting task of getting some interesting data off a 100
MB Zip
disk for my <a href="https://npjg.github.io">Media Station</a> project. Yes, <em>that</em> Zip. The <a href="https://www.grc.com/tip/codfaq4.htm">Click of Death</a>
kind.</p>
<p>Someone gave me lovely Tangent tower for free the other day - that&rsquo;s another
topic - and there was a Zip drive in it. It was manufactured in 2000. I just
hoped there weren&rsquo;t many hours on it. I didn&rsquo;t have a spare disk to check if the
drive was good - I probably should have gotten one to test with.</p>
<p>After carefully inspecting the disk to try to ensure the surface wasn&rsquo;t torn, I
put the disk into the drive and started up Windows 98. The disk seemed to load
okay, but I got the dreaded &ldquo;This disk needs to be formatted&rdquo; error. However, I had
good reason to suspect this was a Mac disk. So, the age old question, how to
image a Mac disk on Windows 98?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;d had an ATAPI-to-USB adapter, connecting the Zip drive to my modern system
would have been easy. But I only have a plain IDE adapter. So, I tried some
other things instead:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>WinImage 6.0</em>. Crashed on clicking &ldquo;Read Disk&rdquo;. I suspect this function was
only designed for reading floppies and didn&rsquo;t know what to do with a 100 MB
disk ðŸ™ƒ</li>
<li><em>WinImage 8.0</em>. The drive made a funny &ldquo;scrubbing&rdquo; sound that sure sounded
like head bashing to me. It didn&rsquo;t <em>sound</em> like examples of the Click of
Death that I listened to online, but I was still really worried that the disk and
or/drive were toast.</li>
<li><em>Norton Ghost 2003</em>. The Zip drive didn&rsquo;t even show up when booting from the Ghost
CD-ROM :(</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d spent two hours on this and was really mad. So I pulled out a CD-R and did
what I probably should have done in the first place - burned an ancient Linux
distro from 2005. That seemed like a good fit for my 500 MHz, 384 MB RAM system.
Thankfully, it was recent enough to enable booting from CDs in the first place.</p>
<p>This old distro didn&rsquo;t have <code>ddrescue</code>, but thankfully good ol&rsquo; <code>dd</code> did the trick.
I was dealing with an ancient version of dd that didnâ€™t have <code>status=progress</code>. So
my trusty AI friends recommended using the USR1 signal, which I didnâ€™t know
about.</p>
<p>The imaging completed fairly quickly with no apparent errors, so I copied the
image to the the CompactFlash disk in the tower, then to my modern machine. A
quick inspection in the hex editor revealed this was in fact an HFS disk!</p>
<p><img src="/posts/no-click-of-death-here/yay-hfs.png"></p>
<p>So it just needed to be mounted in SheepShaver. Unfortunately, the contents were
pretty boring - no engine source code. But the process was interesting!</p>
<p>What have your experiences been with ZIP disks? Ever experienced data loss due
to the dreaded Click of Death?</p>
